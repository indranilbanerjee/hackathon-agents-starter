## üéØ Demo Creation Strategies

### **1. Business-First Approach**

#### **Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Impact Structure**
```markdown
# Demo Script Template

## 1. The Problem (30 seconds)
"Sales teams spend 4 hours weekly chasing overdue invoices..."
- Show manual process (spreadsheets, emails)
- Highlight pain points (time waste, human error)
- Quantify the cost ($50K/year in lost productivity)

## 2. The Solution (2 minutes)
"Our Smart Payment Follow-Up Agent automates this entirely..."
- Live demo of agent processing invoices
- Show multi-channel escalation (WhatsApp ‚Üí Email ‚Üí Call)
- Demonstrate real-time dashboard

## 3. The Impact (30 seconds)
"Result: 90% faster payment collection, 50% reduction in overdue invoices"
- Show before/after metrics
- ROI calculation
- Customer testimonials
```

### **2. Interactive Demo Types**

#### **A. Live API Demonstration**
```typescript
// Create interactive demo endpoint
// app/api/demo/payment-follow-up/route.ts
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const demoData = {
    invoices: [
      {
        id: "DEMO-001",
        amount: 2500.00,
        due_date: "2025-10-01", // Past due
        customer: "Acme Corp",
        status: "overdue"
      }
    ]
  };
  
  // Process with demo-safe data
  const result = await processPaymentFollowUp(demoData);
  
  return NextResponse.json({
    ...result,
    demo_mode: true,
    message: "This is a demo - no actual messages were sent"
  });
}
```

#### **B. Recorded Video Walkthrough**
```bash
# Tools for screen recording
# - Loom (free tier, easy sharing)
# - OBS Studio (free, professional quality)
# - Camtasia (paid, advanced editing)
# - CloudApp (quick recordings)

# Video structure (5-7 minutes max):
# 1. Hook (0-15s): "Watch this agent save 4 hours of work"
# 2. Problem (15-45s): Show manual process
# 3. Solution (45s-4m): Live demo
# 4. Results (4-5m): Show outcomes
# 5. CTA (5-7m): "Try it yourself"
```

#### **C. Interactive Playground**
```typescript
// Create a demo playground page
// app/demo/page.tsx
export default function DemoPlayground() {
  const [selectedAgent, setSelectedAgent] = useState('payment-follow-up');
  const [demoData, setDemoData] = useState(null);
  const [result, setResult] = useState(null);
  
  const runDemo = async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/demo/${selectedAgent}`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(demoData)
    });
    
    const result = await response.json();
    setResult(result);
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="demo-playground">
      <AgentSelector onChange={setSelectedAgent} />
      <DataInput onChange={setDemoData} />
      <RunButton onClick={runDemo} />
      <ResultDisplay result={result} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
